# Background_Removal_Change
Background-Removal-Change is one the image processing project.
To implement background removal and change we should get the object mask image from orginal image and there are several method to get mask image.
The most effectvie method is using Deep Learning Models.
I used the DIS pre-trained model to get the Mask Image and using this model I get clear mask image successfully.
After getting the Mask image, using Original image and Maks image get the background removed object image.
And then implemented Background Change by performing manipulation between object image and background image.
The results is background_changed_result directory.
